# Bilingualism ET data explorer  

## Purpose
This is a Shiny app designed to allow for the exploration of the data collected as part of the "Is mere exposure enough?" project, see [here](https://osf.io/53gh2/).  
It allows for the AOIs to be customised, and will then show the proportion of participants looking at each of the AOIs (or the first AOI they looked at) over the course of the trial.

## Usage

This project should be cloned/downloaded and the opened in R Studio using the project (.Rproj) file. R Studio should then download all the neccessary libraries needed to run the project.  
Once this is done open the app.R file and choose the 'Run App' button from the top of the source editor.
