# This is a Shiny web application for exploring the ET data from the OSF repo:
# https://osf.io/53gh2/

# Helper functions for downloading the data and converting it from matthe mat
# files are included, but not currently implemented in the app.

# You can run the application by clicking the 'Run App' button above.
